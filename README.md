# Segmentation-UNET
The welding_spot_detect_unet.ipynb" is structured for welding spot detection using a U-Net-based segmentation model. 
U-Net + FPN (Feature Pyramid Network) is a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines the strengths of U-Net and FPN for improved semantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging, remote sensing, and other dense prediction tasks.
